                "descript": "Frank and Olive Sinkey occupied 2535 B Street as early as 1921, then bought it from Ludwig Pauley in 1923 for $7,500. Frank was employed by Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad as chief dispatcher—a highly responsible position. Although built of wood, not the masonry preferred for more costly Prairie School houses, the Sinkeys’ house shared many characteristics of that style including the low-pitched hipped roof, wide eaves, varied windows, and especially the unusual porch. The porch is framed by buttress-like walls with stepped parapets supporting the shed roof, and partially screened with sturdy latticework panels."},

                "descript": "This home was built by Daniel and Anna Risser around 1894. Daniel was a bookkeeper for W.J. Cooper & Cole Brothers, a plumbing supply business. Both of the Rissers resided in the house until their deaths. Anna died in 1906 and Daniel in 1917. As with many of Lincoln’s nineteenth century houses, the front porch of the Risser House was remodeled in the early twentieth century, replacing the fancier turned “Victorian” spindles and posts with more austere neoclassical columns and railings. A 1910 building permit allows us to date this remodeling. The front porch needed further attention when Gary Engelman purchased the property in 1987. He had new porch spindles made from salvaged ones and replaced the column bases. Around the same time, Steve Schneider of S&S Restorations helped paint the house to match the late Victorian scheme. The north entry, featuring a glass side-light and interesting brass hardware, leads through a small vestibule to the foyer and main stairway. During various remodeling projects, the staircase was walled in to meet fire codes for a multiple user facility. The steps from the landing to the first floor have since been restored to their original rounded design. A burst radiator on the third floor was the catalyst for Gary to upgrade the wiring, reopen the staircase, refinish the oak floors and replace the ceilings in the living room and second floor family room. The beautiful stain glassed window on the staircase landing was designed and made by Harry Timken of Palace Glass. The original woodwork throughout the house was lovingly cleaned of its layers of o by owners Gary Engelman and Diane Wing, and their army of friends. The living room boasts a wonderful leaded, glass transform, and a tremendous feature of the library/study is the stunning floor to ceiling bay window. The bay window is mirrored in the middle bedroom which is located directly above on the second floor. The Risser house includes two fireplaces, one in the library/study, and one directly above in the current master bedroom. A previous owner exposed the brick behind the stunning wood mantle on the first floor."},

                "descript": "Ludwig Pauley frequently obtained multiple building permits on a single visit to city offices. In August 1920, he “pulled” permits for four adjacent houses on 26th and B Streets—2543 B on the corner, 2535 B adjacent to the west, and 1317 and 1345 South 26th Street to the south. The houses are dissimilar in style but quite similar in estimated cost, ranging from $3,000 for the 26th Street houses, to $4,000 for the corner building, and $3,500 for 2535 B on the west. Harry Marx, founder of Guarantee Clothing Company and a leader in Lincoln’s Jewish community, bought 2543 B Street in 1921 and owned it with his wife Esther for 25 years. Both Marx and Ludwig’s father Conrad Pauley were born in Russia and came to Nebraska as young men."}
